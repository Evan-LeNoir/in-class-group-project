    <p>Hello! My name is Joseph Jordan. I'm very new to coding and feel like this career change is the best decision I've made in a long time. I've always been good at figuring things out and I've always liked a good challenge. I really get to put my skills to the test when it comes to coding. I'm very excited to become a Jr. Web Developer and maybe someday an Ethical Hacker.</p>

    <p>My Project… I want to create a web page that compiles recipes of superfoods, how many vitamins, minerals and nutrients your body needs daily, and how to receive those vitamins, minerals and nutrients by consuming superfoods. Elevator Pitch… I’d like the opportunity to educate people about the many health benefits of consuming superfoods and the many health risks you could avoid by consuming these superfoods on a daily basis. Using food as medicine is not a common practice and I’d like to change that. <a href="https://github.com/Jumpman314?tab=repositories">Here</a> is the link to my GitHub.</p>
