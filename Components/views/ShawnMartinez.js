    <p>Hello my name is Shawn Martinez. I am currently a SavvyCoder student learning vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML in my journey to becoming a web developer. I have a down to earth approach to things with the zest for learning and solving problems. I have always been up to the challenge when it comes to anything in life and I know this will be the same for coding.</p>
