        <p>My name is Evan. I come from a background of law enforcement & mechanical engineering. Since I was 9yrs old, my brother and I would tinker with computers because we found the machine to be interesting in how it worked. I began messing with crude HTML around 10yrs old but never got serious with it; I didn't quite know how serious it could get.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2013, I began tinkering with Java off and on then getting more indepth with HMTL and finally introduced myself to CSS. Discovering the vast languages, especially CSS was an eye opener and has been intriguing to me ever since.</p>
        <p>Now I attend Savvy Coders to officially get a foot in the door of IT. To say that I'm excited about this would be an understatement!</p>
