  <h2><strong>Work/Education History:</strong></h2>
  <p>I am an aspiring web developer who has been working in the field of construction for the last 17 years. I also spent three years at Central Michigan University, and have previously gone through an online coding bootcamp for Ruby. I am now enrolled at Savvy Coders in hopes of furthering my education with a focus on JavaScript.</p>
  <br>
  <h2><strong>My Development Project:</strong></h2>
  <p>Currently I am working on developing a fishing website that will both provide information about fishing lakes in various states, and allow users to interact with one another. This will serve as the Capstone Project for my Savvy Coders cohort.</p>
