      <h2>Hi!</h2>
      <h2>I'm Jonathan Dove.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently working towards a junior developer role. However, I've taken a varied path on
        the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked at a hardware store, to a bagel shop, to selling knives. Then I worked for a
        catering company and the post office before moving to Denver to become a veterinary
        technician.
      </p>
      <p>
        That didn't work out well and so I worked at a direct mailing company where I packed boxes
        and stuffed envelopes. However, that let me move into a desk job where I stayed for the last
        several years.
      </p>

          <li>
            I've dabbled in coding for several years now and have a few languages I'm dangerous
            with, but I haven't mastered any yet.
          </li>
          <li>I have an Associates in Applied Animal Science.</li>
          <li>
            Other than the long list about, the direct mailing company I worked for was the longest.
            I worked there for seventeen years. I learned multiples roles and did a large variety of
            jobs in my time there.
