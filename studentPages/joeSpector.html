    I started working in retail at age 16. I continued with it for a few years and built some experience, and currently still use it today. My jobs included a few supermarkets, then i switched it up and did 6 months in maintenance work. Decided to go back into retail and work in grocery today.
    I'm a quick learner, creative, focused, and responsible.
    Graduated from high school in 2014. Looking to further education in the tech and business fields.

My project is a social media that is supposed to be educational and inspirational. Posts will be checked and verified before they are uploaded. It will also promote strong mental health and resources for anyone who may be struggling during these unprecedented times.
