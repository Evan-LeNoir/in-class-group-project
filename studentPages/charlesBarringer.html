<p>I really like games and enjoy watching Youtube videos about a whole bunch of topics. I like Bethesda games the most not for its stories but due to the modding community that I really love due to how amazing of a job there work accomplishes that Bethesda themselves could never due.</p>

<p>
  My Second favorite franchise is Warhammer fantasy and the total war franchise in general. Its an rts with turn based mechanics built into its campaign's.
